Hi everyone,

In this tutorial I'll teach you how to make a Tic Tac Toe game using Python.
This is a very simple code that I learn during my Pyhton course, so I believe that everybody will be able to undestand what I did in every line of the code.
Every change and code improve is welcome. I hope you enjoy and can have some fun! 

Here we go...


So first, we have to define the how big will be our board, to do this, we will set board as **board = [" " for i in range(9)]**, that basically says that our board will have 9 blank spaces that can be filled.
